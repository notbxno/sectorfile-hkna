===== HKNW Delivery =====

  * HKNW doesn't have a dedicated Delivery Position, with Wilson Ground (HKNW_GND) assuming the role of Delivery.

==== Flight Level Restrictions ====

**All restrictions to be reviewed and inserted.**



==== IFR Clearance Rules ====

**Phraseology**

  * [callsign], cleared to [destination], [SID] departure via the [transition] transition, climb initially [FL], squawk [squawk].
  * [callsign], cleared to [destination], [SID] departure, climb initially [FL], squawk [squawk].
  * [callsign], cleared to [destination], via the [airway name] airway, passing FL100, proceed direct [first waypoint] then as filed, climb initially [FL], squawk [squawk]

If a flight has no SID, the flight is to be given the "passing FL100, proceed direct to waypoint".

i.e.

KQA257, cleared to Wajir, passing FL100, proceed direct TEVIN, climb FL110, squawk 5334.

==== VFR Clearance Rules ===

VFR aircraft clearance must come from the tower controller, but the ground controller should get some information from the pilot and taxi them out to a runway before they receive their clearance. 
 
When a VFR aircraft calls for clearance, they must include the following: 
-	Souls on board 
-	Fuel on board 
-	Intentions 
 
If the aircraft does not include any of the above, the information must be requested before a clearance is given. 
 
Once all the information has been received from the pilot, the controller must then issue start clearance and taxi instructions to a runway holding point. Once the aircraft is at the holding point, they can receive their clearance. 
 
At this point the aircraft must be handed to tower so that the tower controller can provide the aircraft with a clearance. 

=== Cruise Level Rules ===

* Kenyan Airspace operates with the following RVSM standard table of Cruising Levels.

==== Departure Procedures & Initial Climbs ====

Initial Climbs at Nairobi aren't based off the SID themselves, but rather the direction and type of flight. See the table below for the criteria.

^ Type ^ Direction ^ Initial Climb ^
| Domestic | Westbound | FL100 |
| Domestic | Eastbound | FL110 |
| International | Westbound | FL180 |
| International | Eastbound | FL190 |
